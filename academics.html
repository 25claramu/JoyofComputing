        <h1><center>About My Academics<center></h1>
        <p class="writing"><center>I would like to speak Spanish! I have been learning Spanish in school for two and a half years, and I plan on taking it for three more. I hope that by the time I graduate high school I am able to speak and understand somewhat fluently.<center></p><img class="images" src="https://www.dictionary.com/e/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/1000x700-spanish-1-790x310.jpg" width="350" height="250">
        <p class="writing"><center> In 9th grade I completed my I-Search, a very long research paper on whatever topic we were interested in. My topic was sustainable agriculture. This project introduced me to ideas I had never heard of and people I had never met!<center></p><img class="images" src="https://www.organicauthority.com/.image/t_share/MTU5MzMwMTAzODIwMTAxMjE2/sustainable-agriculture-is-the-best-way-to-feed-the-world-new-research-confirms.jpg"  width="350" height="250">
        <h1><center>Joy of Computing<center></h1>
        <p class="writing"><center>In the second semester of Joy Of Computing I learned so much about how css can be applied to all aspects of life. Countries all over the world are starting to use AI, facial recognition software and even robots to monitor their citizens, and some people have very polarizing opinions about this. We watched many videos about css in the news and through that I learned about self driving cars and the challenges and benefits they bring. As a class we used data from our school water fountain to figure out what time of the day the most people were drinking and to make different graphs using our data. I spent weeks working on Code HS and learning about HTML and how to build different website features. Now when I look at websites or Iâ€™m scrolling through a page, I can recognize different aspects and think about how they were coded. Using small tablets my class made our own apps and were even able to draw with them. Also in Code HS I coded gravity and punnett squares, which was actually really difficult, doing this I was able to combine some science and coding. Overall Joy of Computing was a very educational experience.<center></p><img class="images" src="collage.jpg" width="350" height="250"
